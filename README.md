# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Java. It uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface.

## How to Play

1. Run the `SnakeGame` class to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
3. Try to eat the apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the game borders.
5. The game ends when you collide with the snake's own body or the borders.
